# MC-MP2-Relativistic

The project implements Monte Carlo second order many-body perturbation theory for relativistic systems (MC-MP2-Relativistic). The algorithm was developed at Hirata Theoretical Chemistry Lab. The code is still a beta version.


## Geeting Started.

The code can run with MPI in multiple CPUs.

### Prerequisites:

1. C++14 compilant compiler.
2. MP1 2.0 version or newer.

#### Notes:

The code can calculate the MC-MP2 energy for non-relativistic systems through the .movecs file generated by NWCHEM after a single point energy calculation. In order to calculate the MP2 relativistic energy are needed the output files of the four component relativistic single point calculation from the UTCHEM code.
